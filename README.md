It's a  fully responsive landing website created for a small laundry business that has an option to book services too.

Technologies used:  HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express, EJS, Nodemailer.

As mentioned above its a simple responsive landing page designed for a laundry aggregator business wherein customers can book their service through the 'orders' page, 
once you add to the cart it will be redirected to the 'cart' page, once you click on order, a mail will be sent (Using nodemailer) to the business owner wherein he delivers the service.

The code is not organised, so please do forgive me. (As I'm a beginner, I'll try to improve in my upcoming projects)
